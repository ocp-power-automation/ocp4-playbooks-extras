ocp-descheduler
============

The Descheduler Operator lets OpenShift Container Platform administrators to configure the profiles based on specific strategies for evicting the pods for efficient resource utilization under conditions such as Nodes are underutilized or overutilize, When pods and affinity requirements has changed and no longer appropriate for certain nodes, Node failure requires pods to be moved, New nodes are added to clusters, Pods have been restarted too many times.

This playbook contains two modules:
1. Installation of the descheduler operator
2. Running the end to end tests for descheduler operator from `openshift-tests-private` repository that comprises with different test scenarios and profiles.
