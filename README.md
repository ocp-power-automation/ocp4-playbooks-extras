## Assumptions:

 - A healthy OpenShift 4 cluster in running state.

## Setting up inventory

Make use of sample file at `examples/inventory`.

```
cp examples/inventory .
```

## Run the playbooks

Run all playbooks at once or specific playbook as shown below.

### Run all playbooks

To set up variables make use of the sample file at `examples/all.yaml`. Modify the values as per your cluster.

```
cp examples/all.yaml .
```

Once you have configured the vars & inventory file, run the playbook using:

```
ansible-playbook  -i inventory -e @all.yaml playbooks/main.yml
```

### Run specific playbook

To set up variables for specific playbook make use of the sample file at `examples/<playbook_vars.yaml>`. Modify the values as per your cluster. For more information refer to examples.

```
cp examples/<playbook_vars.yaml> .
```

Once you have configured the vars & inventory file, run the specific playbook using:

```
ansible-playbook  -i inventory -e @<playbook_vars.yaml> playbooks/main.yml
```

**Note:**  
The Ansible playbook fails when a role requires the `make` module or when running all playbooks using `playbooks/main.yaml`, as described in [Issue 42](https://github.com/ocp-power-automation/ocp4-playbooks-extras/issues/42).
